## What this is

**Reimbursements F5** — a browser-only receipt → reimbursement-report app.
Receipts are read **on-device** (OCR + visual logo recognition), reviewed in a
keyboard sweep, and exported as a themed multi-sheet Excel workbook. Local-first
(IndexedDB); **optional** Supabase layer adds auth/sync/realtime and a
server-keyed AI assist. Static build, embeddable (Carrd), PWA.

Rebuilt from scratch from the Python app in `../Reimbursements` (see its
`CLAUDE.md`); the extraction *ideas/data* are ported, not the code. Intended to
be transplanted to `duedev/ReimbursementsF5`.

## Stack

Vite 7 · TypeScript · Svelte 5 (runes) · Tesseract.js (default OCR, vendored) ·
PaddleOCR on onnxruntime-web (opt-in tier) · transformers.js CLIP (logo layer,
lazy) · ExcelJS + Chart.js (export) · idb · @supabase/supabase-js (optional) ·
vite-plugin-pwa. Fonts self-hosted (@fontsource Inter + Fraunces).

## Map

| Path | What lives here |
|---|---|
| `src/types.ts` | Domain model: Receipt/Batch/Job/Field/Flag/LogoMatch/StoredBrand |
| `src/pipeline/pipeline.ts` | Per-receipt flow: clean → hash/cache → OCR → rules → **logo fusion** → vision assist → dedup → status |
| `src/pipeline/imagePrep.ts` | canvas prep: EXIF rotate → (opt) perspective → grayscale → edge-energy autocrop → downscale |
| `src/pipeline/perspective.ts` | opt-in OpenCV.js quad detect + warp (`VITE_PERSPECTIVE=1`, vendored lib) |
| `src/pipeline/ocr.ts` | `OcrEngine` seam; Tesseract default; `VITE_OCR_ENGINE=paddle` → `engines/paddle/*` (ONNX det+rec+CTC) |
| `src/config/vendors.ts` | Brand matcher: curated table + `src/data/vendorDb.extra.json` (generated, 329 brands); passes: exact → glyph-normalized (`normalizeGlyphs`) → bounded fuzzy (`fuzzyMatchVendor`); slogans as long aliases |
| `src/pipeline/extract.ts` | Rules: grand-total tiers + reconcile, US-first dates, tax, vendor line heuristic + fuzzy hook, confidence, flags; per-field `bbox` powers review markers/callouts |
| `src/pipeline/logo/` | Visual logo layer: `embedder.ts` (CLIP seam, lazy, test-fakeable), `index.ts` (bundled `logoIndex.json` + user brands, cosine NN, header-band crop, `addBrandFromImage`), `fuse.ts` (Layer-3 fusion; `LOGO_ACCEPT`) — inert (no model download) while the index is empty |
| `src/pipeline/vision/` | Opt-in AI assist (OpenRouter/Gemini/Anthropic), spend cap, build-time free key; signed-in users route via `supabase/aiProxy.ts` → `ai-extract` Edge Function |
| `src/store/` | `db.ts` (IndexedDB v1: batches/receipts/jobs/blobs/brands/kv), `repo.ts` (the one read/write + notify seam), `sync.ts` (Supabase mirror: LWW on `updatedAt`, storage blobs, realtime) |
| `src/supabase/` | `client.ts` (null unless `VITE_SUPABASE_URL/ANON_KEY`), `auth.ts`, `aiProxy.ts` |
| `src/ui/` | Svelte 5: `theme.css` (tokens, light/dark), `state.svelte.ts` (the one reactive bridge), `App/Landing(hero+marketing)/Workspace/Card/Dropzone/ReviewModal/ExportBar/Settings/Toasts/ThemeToggle` |
| `src/export/` | `workbook.ts` (themed xlsx), `charts.ts` (Chart.js→PNG for Insights), `insights.ts`, `csv.ts`, `images.ts` |
| `supabase/` | `migrations/0001_core.sql` (tables+RLS+storage+realtime), `0002_pgvector.sql` (optional), `functions/ai-extract` (key-holding chat-completions proxy), `functions/logo-search` |
| `scripts/` | `vendor-tesseract.mjs` (prebuild), `vendor-paddle.mjs` (opt-in), `export_vendor_db.py` (regenerates vendorDb.extra.json from `../Reimbursements/vendor_db.py`), `gen-icons.mjs` |
| `tests/` | node:test via tsx; `testkit/` = the fixed 9-challenge accuracy gate (+ logo case); `e2e.mjs` + `screenshots.mjs` (Playwright vs `vite preview`) |

## Commands

`npm run dev` · `npm test` · `npm run testkit` · `npm run typecheck` (tsc +
svelte-check) · `npm run build` · `npm run e2e` · `node tests/screenshots.mjs`.

## Gotchas

- **Svelte $state proxies can't enter IndexedDB** — `structuredClone` throws on
  them. Unwrap with `$state.snapshot(...)` before any `repo` write that carries
  objects from reactive state (see `ReviewModal.patchFromForm`).
- **Money parsing is US-first and deliberately strict** (`util/money.ts` +
  `MONEY_SRC` in `extract.ts`): a single dot with 3 decimals is a *decimal*
  ("$3.499/gal", "11.204 GAL"), never thousands grouping — the permissive form
  read gallons as $11,204 and promoted it to the total. Dot-grouping only
  counts as money with a comma-cents tail. Within a total tier the **largest**
  value wins (FUEL TOTAL vs combined TOTAL, as in the original app), and the
  line *below* a label-only TOTAL must match strict money (a lenient grab
  there turned "Date: 05/10/2026" into a $2,026 total).
- **Copy a picker's FileList before clearing `input.value`**
  (Landing/Dropzone `onPicked`) — resetting the input empties the live
  FileList mid-await, silently dropping every file after the first.
- **`npm run e2e` is the real-OCR accuracy gate** — three receipts (easy
  coffee, fuel with per-gallon pricing + FUEL TOTAL, split-label TOTAL) run
  through actual Tesseract in Chromium with per-receipt amount assertions. The
  testkit exercises the rules on synthetic text only; regressions in the real
  path show up here.
- **Digit-only brand aliases ("76") are excluded from the glyph pass** — its
  punctuation stripping would turn a price ending `.76` into a brand hit; the
  exact pass (with the numeric boundary guard) is where they match.
- The logo layer never downloads the CLIP model while the index is empty
  (`logoIndexAvailable()` gate). Tests inject a fake via `setEmbedderFactory`.
- Export modules (ExcelJS/Chart.js) are **lazy-imported** in `ExportBar` — keep
  it that way; they dominated the main chunk otherwise.
- `buildWorkbook` must keep working headless (Node tests): chart rendering
  returns null without a DOM and the workbook builds without images.
- Curated `KNOWN_VENDORS` beats the generated JSON on name conflicts; regenerate
  the JSON with `python3 scripts/export_vendor_db.py` (commit the result).
- `.env.example` lists every knob; all optional. Deploy secrets/vars are wired
  in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
